## Project briefing

First and foremost, welcome to the project briefing. We will be focusing on describing the project hierarchy, quotations for each part of the process and running through that process from start to end.

### Breaking down the objective

For this project we will be aiming towards a modern, optimized and brand wide consistent web identity for your business. Our objective should be to have a cohesive mass that works well for both your clients and your business. Nowadays a brand's web identity is becoming more and more important. It's of the essence to get _and_ maintain a solid website, when everybody uses their personal devices to browse the web, and thus also your website.

From now on I will refer to the process as the "Development phase".
