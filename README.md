# Project briefing

First and foremost, welcome to the project briefing. We will be focusing on:

* Describing the project objective

* Running through the process from start to end

* Setting up quotations for each part of that process

## Breaking down the objective

For this project we will be aiming towards a modern, optimized and brand wide consistent web identity for your business. Our objective should be to have a cohesive mass that works well for both your clients and your business. Nowadays a brand's web identity is becoming more and more important. It's of the essence to get _and_ maintain a solid website, when everybody uses their personal devices to browse the web, and thus also your website.

From now on I will refer to the process as the **_Development phase_**.

## Development phase

In our development phase we will go through all the different sections of creating your brand's website. We're talking about wireframing, clickable mockups and for example the choice of framework we will be using for the project. Every part of the development phase will be thoroughly explained and documented beneath.

### Designing the project

#### 1. Wireframing for all pages

#### 2. Creating a brand wide styleguide

#### 3. Redesign of all pages using the consistency of the styleguide

#### 6. Set uo a (scalable) framework I will use to build the website

#### 7. Build all pages based on the mockups

#### 8. Refractor and optimize the codebase

#### 9. Finalize the repo and make it ready to deploy

#### 10. Hosting the deployed website
