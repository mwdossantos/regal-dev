## Regal

Nice to have you here! Check out our [Wiki](https://github.com/mwdossantos/regal-dev/wiki) for a complete rundown on the project road map. This `README.md` will be updated when development furthers.

## CMS branch

Please use the `cms-branch` for all pushes from now on, as I don't want to mess up the front end. 

## Live website up till now

To have a sneak peak of the website being built keep an eye on this [link](https://mwdossantos.github.io/regal-dev/).

I am currently busy working out the CMS for the backend so that you can edit the website easily and for example make blog posts.
